        <p>
            When debugging applications, many people tend to write their own tracing tools for the needed rush and get rid of them when the problem is fixed. This has to be done again when another problem arises. If the application supports multiple threads, building an efficient trace system becomes more complicated, but is much more needed as stepping in the code becomes useless. You all know what I mean ...
            This utility makes it simple to add traces to an existing program. Its modular design group all complex functionalities within a dynamic library that remain outside of the application. The only thing needed to make the connection is the inclusion of a cpp file into the project and the availability of 2 header files. yes you'll have to instrument your codeâ€¦ but just a little.
            Useful information like timestamp and thread identifier are taken by the dynamic library module itself. No need to add extra code to find out which thread the trace is in.
            Module name is displayed in the viewer so it's easy to know where the trace comes from when debugging multiple modules.
            Very useful when debugging real-time applications, multithreaded applications, system containing multiple modules, distributed systems and more.

        Supported languages and platforms

        Native C++ is supported on all three platforms (Linux, Windows and OS X).

        C# support via a connection assembly.

        Plans to build some extra connection modules in the future for the Android and iOS operating system as well as for Java.
