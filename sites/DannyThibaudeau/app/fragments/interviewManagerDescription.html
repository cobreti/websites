<p>
  This is a project made in a Client-Server course for my master degree.<br><br>
  It consisted of a server made in Java connected to an sql database and a graphical user interface made using C# and WPF.<br><br>
  For simplicity reasons, the connection part to the server has been replaced by stubs to allow the client to work by itself without any installation required.<br><br>
